**Verilog**
==========================

**Overview**
-----------

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Verilog-based course project, which demonstrates my understanding of digital design principles and Verilog programming language.

**Project Description**
---------------------

The project involves designing and implementing a basic, combinational logic, sequential logics and state machines using Verilog HDL. The design is implemented and tested using intel quartus prime.


**How to Use**
--------------

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/Danishnoor5/verilog-course-project.git`.
2. Open the project in your preferred Verilog editor or IDE.
3. Compile and simulate the design using the provided testbenches.
4. Review the simulation results and output files.
